# Sonar Rock Prediction

This project uses a machine learning model to predict whether an object is a rock or a mine based on sonar signals.

## Project Structure

- `Sonar.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `readme.md`: Project documentation.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Sonar dataset, which contains 208 instances and 60 attributes. Each attribute is a measure of the energy within a particular frequency band, integrated over a certain period of time. The label indicates whether the object is a rock (R) or a mine (M).

## Installation

To run the code, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install the required packages using:

## Usage

1. Open the `SOnar.ipynb` notebook.
2. Run the cells sequentially to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Model

The model used in this project is a Random Forest classifier. The notebook includes steps for:

- Data loading and exploration
- Data preprocessing
- Model training
- Model evaluation

## Results

The model achieved an accuracy of XX% on the test set. Further details on the model performance can be found in the `SOnar.ipynb` notebook.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to use machine learning to classify objects based on sonar signals. The Random Forest classifier provided good results, but further tuning and experimentation could improve the performance.
